Ms. Hermione Jean Granger (b. 19 September, 1979) was a Muggle-born witch born to Mr and Mrs Granger, both dentists. At the age of eleven she learned that she was a witch, and had been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. Hermione possessed a brilliant academic mind, and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied.

 

Hermione played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War, as well. In 1997 she fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters, alongside the Order of the Phoenix. She and Ron both decided not to return to Hogwarts for their final year of studies, instead choosing to accompany Harry on his quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. Hermione then fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, as well as destroying Hufflepuff's Cup, a Horcrux with Ron Weasley, using a basilisk fang found in the Chamber of Secrets (then opened by Ron imitating Harry saying "open" in Parseltongue).

 

Following the Second Wizarding War, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to complete her education. She later found employment with the Ministry of Magic, furthering the cause for the better treatment of house-elves. Afterward she was promoted to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

 

Hemione is engaged to Ron Weasley. Hermione is excited to rejoin the muggle world, part time of course, and teach the History of Magic at CCA. In her spare time, Hermione works on her campaign and hopes to be elected as the Minister of Magic
